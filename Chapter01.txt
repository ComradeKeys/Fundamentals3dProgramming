Why 3D?
=======
First we must ask ourselves why we are wanting to do 3D programming in the first place. To help answer that question let us first look at some of the interesting applications of 3D programming we have seen:

//I need to get screenshots of these
- Stellarium
- RealFlight
- SuperTuxKart
- OpenArena
- X Screensaver

So you can look at these projects and see that there are many applications for 3D programming that apply in both a practical sense and for entertainment. With advanced physics libraries such as Bullet Physics[footnote needed] it is possible to simulate robotics and the automation of varoius forms of labor. The ability to simulate a real world situation, or even having the ability to simulate and define your own world is a very powerful tool for any software developer to have in their toolbox.
