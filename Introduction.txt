With the rise of virtual reality 3D programming is becoming an increasingly popular medium for application development. As we move forward into understanding the many aspects of 3D simulation this books keeps freedom in mind from this publication to the libraries mentioned in the book. Due to the educational nature of this publication the book itself is under the Against DRM 2.0 license while the code written is under the GNU General Public license version 3 or later.

The Scope of this document
==========================
This document is targeted towards people who already know basic programming constructs and this document implies the reader has this understanding. This book uses C++17 and uses Irrlicht, cAudio, and Bullet Physics which are all under free software licenses. An understanding of C++ would be very beneficial in reading this book however any programmer should be able to get something out of it. A book such as this might serve well in inspiring developers less experienced.
